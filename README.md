# DSA Cancellation Checker
Scans for changes in available driving test appointments.

## Setup:
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download correct `chromedriver.exe` file for [your version of Chrome](see chrome://version)
3. Change settings in `info.py`
4. Run `python CancellationChecker.py`

This will not change your appointment, all it does is alert you of any available appointments before your currently booked one.
This is also likely outdated for the current driving test website.
